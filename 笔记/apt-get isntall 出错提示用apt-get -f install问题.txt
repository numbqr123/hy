You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

 exim4-base : Depends: exim4-config (>= 4.30) but it is not going to be installed or

                       exim4-config-2

 postfix : Conflicts: mail-transport-agent

 sendmail-bin : Depends: sendmail-base but it is not going to be installed

                Depends: sendmail-cf but it is not going to be installed

                Conflicts: mail-transport-agent

E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

解决方法：

#apt-get --fix-broken install
